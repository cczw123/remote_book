<h2>Translations</h2>
<p>Translations to other languages are highly encouraged. Each official translation will be held as a separate repository in the <a href="https://github.com/MostlyAdequate">MostlyAdequate organization</a> and linked from the English version book.
Since each translation is a different repository, we can also have different maintainers for each project.</p>
<h3>Creating a New Translation Repo</h3>
<p>In order to create a new translation, you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide">main repo</a>.</li>
<li>Add yourself to the watch list of the main repo, to keep up with changes.</li>
<li>When translating chapters, <strong>create NEW files with suffix of your language</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, Spanish tranlation for <code>ch01.md</code> will be on <code>ch01-es.md</code>.</li>
<li>Open a <a href="https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/issues/new">new issue</a> and ask to be part of the organization.</li>
<li>Transfer the repo to the organization.</li>
<li>Merge new content from the main repo.</li>
<li>keep translating...</li>
<li>Rinse/repeat last two steps until the book is done.</li>
</ul>
